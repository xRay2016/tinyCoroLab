/**
 * @brief Welcome to tinycoro lab4c, in this part you will build the basic coroutine
 * synchronization component��wait_group by modifing wait_group.hpp and wait_group.cpp.
 * Please ensure you have read the document of lab4c.
 *
 * @warning You should carefully consider whether each implementation should be thread-safe.
 *
 * You should follow the rules below in this part:
 *
 * @note The location marked by todo is where you must add code, but you can also add code anywhere
 * you want, such as function and class definitions, even member variables.
 *
 * @note lab4 and lab5 are free designed lab, leave the interfaces that the test case will use,
 * and then, enjoy yourself!
